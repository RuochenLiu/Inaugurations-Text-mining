### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2017

+ Projec title: Lexical density of inaugurations
+ This project is conducted by Ruochen Liu

+ Project summary: Focus on the language itself, trying to find some way to evaluate an inauguration mathematically, using lexical density. Lexical density is an important factor in NLP which is simply a measure of how informative and how formal a text is. In practice, use lexical functions to get the lexical words and lexical rate of each sentence, and then we can find if there is a trend in results, like the change of density through the text, the density of whole text, and difference between inaugurations. Maybe we can learn from that when we try to write a speech.
